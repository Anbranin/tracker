For tracking and display of health data. Plenty of apps like this exist,
but none are exactly the way I want them.

Hard Data:
Weight
Sleep hours
Food (that's not just a number, that's harder)
Number and quality of #2s
Amount of caffeine
Pollen count
Number of drinks

Feelings and perceptions:
Cognition
Tiredness
Anxiety
Depression
Acne level
Bloat/Feeling fat

The current idea is to be able to add whatever you need to with the interface,
assign it a color,
and track that.

Views should be in graph form.

There should be a notes section.
